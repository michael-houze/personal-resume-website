## Synopsis

This is the code that I use on my personal website, http://www.mikehouze.com.
This is the site that I direct potentiel employers, clients, or even friends and family who are interested in what I do.

## Purpose

I use this site to provide a quick snapshot of my development skills as well as to tinker and test out new things.  While all of the features implented may not be practical, they are functional and have provided me with a learning experience.

## To-Do List

* ~~Update the background photo (Currently not me)~~
* ~~Update skills (Currently just arbitrary numbers and talents)~~
* Update the about section (Currently lorem ipsum)
* ~~Fix navigation bar CSS (background photo falls behind it in fullscreen)~~
* ~~Change the skill levels and colors on skills Doughnuts~~
* Add download functionality to the Resume navbar link
